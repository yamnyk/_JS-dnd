# Deferred review findings

Every Minor that a final review found and a plan deferred, kept here because the build ledgers live in a temporary folder. Each line says where it came from. Nothing here has been fixed unless the status says so. Status was checked against the code on 2026-11-08, and anyone planning from this list should re-check each line before acting on it.

Legend for status: **open** means still true in the code, **fixed** means a later change closed it, **owner call** means it is a decision for Gogi and not a bug, **covered** means another plan absorbs it.

## A. Atomicity, concurrency, and the database

| Id | Finding | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Reset atomicity is not pinned by a mid-write failure test | Plan 2 | **fixed** (pinned: a failure mid-reset rolls everything back) |
| A2 | Per-fight `seq` is not pinned across two fights | Plan 2 | **fixed** (pinned: seq restarts per fight) |
| A3 | First-open migrate race on a fresh DB (two scripts starting together) | Plan 2 | **fixed** (migrate re-checks under the lock, tested with two processes) |
| A4 | Unconditional `ROLLBACK` can mask the original error, and nested blocks have no `SAVEPOINT` | Plan 2 | open |
| A5 | The tamper path crashes with exit 1 if the DB cannot be opened | Plan 2 | open |
| A6 | `judgeQuest` and `logHint` atomicity is not pinned | Plan 3 | **fixed** (pinned: judge and hint roll back fully) |
| A7 | Fight and move state is read before the transaction opens, so two parallel Bash calls can double-apply (two `move check` give two sure hits, two `fight attack` lose a damage update, two `fight begin` leave two open fights) | Plan 5 | **fixed** (state reads moved inside the transaction, each stale-read mutation is caught by a real-process test that holds the write lock; migrate takes no lock on an up to date database) |
| A8 | `proposeMove` is not atomic (row inserted before the stub is written) and overwrites an existing `move-<id>.js` | Plan 5 | **fixed** (proposal is one unit, an existing stub is kept as .old.js) |
| A9 | Read-only commands take a write lock through `touchWindow`, so `look` can wait behind a status line write | Plan 6 | open |

## B. Game rules and logic gaps

| Id | Finding | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | `--quest <id>` on `fight begin` accepts any existing quest id and skips the warning gate | Plan 5 | **fixed** (a quest fight needs a quest not solved this epoch) |
| B2 | Open moves are orphaned after flee, win, loss, or tamper, and `heroAttack` does not refuse while a move is open | Plan 5 | open |
| B3 | `warnNpc` needs no hero, no world, and no NPC presence | Plan 5 | open |
| B4 | The enemy's initiative roll is not linked in `fight_log` (only the hero's is) | Plan 5 | open |
| B5 | The ending unlock does not check the order of quests and boss: if quests are added later, solving them unlocks the ending again with no new boss win and no `endingUnlocked` flag for the Master | Plan 7 | **fixed** (the boss win must be after the latest solve of this epoch) |
| B6 | Knockout deadlock risk if N1 to N3 are all beaten (quest commands ignore gating, so the Master can still start quests by hand) | Plan 5 | open, mitigated: quest commands do not check the NPC, so the Master can always recover |
| B7 | `quest start`, `check`, and `judge` ignore gating, the hero, and the world | Plan 4 | **fixed** (hero, finished world, and earlier quests solved this epoch are required) |
| B8 | A location named like a slot (for example "L3") hijacks `go` | Plan 4 | open |
| B9 | A passing attempt from before a tamper reset can be judged after it (+8 honor without a re-check) | Plan 3 | open |
| B10 | A solve cannot be revoked by a later cheated verdict | Plan 3 | **fixed** (quest revoke built, solves can be taken back) |
| B11 | Reset overwrites level and abilities without snapshotting them for the ending page | Plan 2 | open |
| B12 | No CLI to list open fights or the honor history | Plan 2 | open |
| B13 | One quest per NPC in the skeleton limits the curriculum | Plan 4 | covered by the curriculum catalog (one NPC per rung, provisional) |

## C. Input validation and CLI behavior

| Id | Finding | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | Duplicate-name check misses inner whitespace and NBSP differences | Plan 4 | open |
| C2 | A non-string field error says "must not be empty" | Plan 4 | open |
| C3 | Zero-width-only names pass, no length caps, `NaN` prints as `null`, repeated flags and duplicate bonus keys keep the last one | Plan 4 | open |
| C4 | A bad option under a tamper exits 1 instead of 2 | Plan 4 | open |
| C5 | Extra positionals are silently dropped on older commands (for example `honor add 5 help helped the baker` stores "helped") | Plan 2 | verify, newer commands reject them |
| C6 | `JSDND_QUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` is unvalidated (0 hangs, NaN throws), test-only | Plan 3 | open |
| C7 | `quest.file` is metadata that disagrees with the real path when `JSDND_PLAYER_DIR` is set, and `quest check` and `quest list` do not print the file path | Plan 3 | **fixed** (quest start, check, and list print the real path) |

## D. Robustness and presentation

| Id | Finding | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | A never-settling promise gives a vague "your code stopped the program" error (matters for the async rungs 4 and 5) | Plans 3 and 5 | **fixed** (a never-settling promise gets a named error) |
| D2 | Lingering timers left by player code are not pinned | Plan 3 | open |
| D3 | The status line hangs if stdin never closes (`readFileSync(0)`) | Plan 6 | open |
| D4 | An estimate-based collapse says "1 hour" when only minutes remain | Plan 6 | open |
| D5 | Long y-axis labels can clip in the ending page charts | Plan 7 | open |
| D6 | The ending hours estimate skips `world_settings`, `npc_warnings`, and `npc_knockouts` timestamps | Plan 7 | open |

## E. Test gaps and flakiness

| Id | Finding | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | Two CLI tests use real `Math.random` on tough fights: about 0.8 percent of suite runs fail (one such red run was seen again during the style work) | Plan 5 | **fixed** (the two tests that needed a tough fight stage it through the library with a scripted rng, the rest use the weak tier where real dice cannot end the fight; ten clean runs of the CLI test file) |
| E2 | Hours tests are weak (some timestamp sources are unpinned) and no test uses more than one save | Plan 7 | **fixed** (every timestamp source and a second save are pinned) |
| E3 | Same-millisecond reset is not tested | Plan 7 | **fixed** (same-millisecond reset and solve are pinned) |
| E4 | Page tests miss attribute quoting, mark `<title>` escaping, the 300-dot cap, and the y clamp | Plan 7 | **fixed** (attribute quoting, mark titles, the dot cap, and the clamp are pinned) |
| E5 | Dice edge inputs (`D20`, trailing space, `007d06`) are not behavior-pinned | Plan 2 | **fixed** (edge inputs pinned) |
| E6 | Link suffix matching (`endsWith` mutation) is not pinned | Plan 3 | **fixed** (exact host matching pinned) |
| E7 | The forge test does not pin the random token, and the dice-roll generated inputs are not individually pinned | Plan 3 | **fixed** (argv and stdin token forge pinned, dice-roll mutants added) |
| E8 | No `heroAttack` rollback test, and the tamper gate test covers 3 of 7 combat commands | Plan 5 | **fixed** (attack rollback and the tamper gate across all seven combat commands) |
| E9 | The play.md drift guard is a substring check and checks no flags | Plan 4 | **fixed** (play.md flags are checked against the usage) |

## F. Docs

| Id | Finding | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | README sample uses the legacy `fight start` and has no example fight | Plan 5 | **fixed** (the README shows a real combat example) |
| F2 | The README tiredness row says play stops until the window resets, which holds for the listed commands only | Plan 6 | **fixed** (the collapse gate covers every play command) |

## G. Owner calls (decisions, not bugs)

| Id | Finding | Source |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | A tamper reset wipes race bonuses (a dwarf loses CON +2) per spec 5.8 | Plan 4 |
| G2 | Reading a legal doc counts as a hint and drops the clean bonus from +8 to +5 | Plan 3 |
| G3 | Player code is not sandboxed (accepted) | Plan 3 |
| G4 | The integrity fingerprint covers `game/dice.js` only, not `game/rolls.js` or `game/cli.js` | Plan 2 |

## Owner calls, decided 2026-11-08

- G1: a tamper reset keeps race bonuses (built).
- G2: reading a legal doc still counts as a hint (kept).
- G3: player code stays unsandboxed (accepted).
- G4: the fingerprint covers `game/dice.js` and `game/rolls.js` (built).
- B10: a late cheated verdict revokes a solve (built as `quest revoke`).

## Found by the final review of the findings plan, 2026-11-08

- Fixed: the parallel tests were blind because `migrate` took the write lock on every open (it now locks only for a missing migration, which also stops read-only commands from waiting behind a writer).
- Fixed: a missing or broken `game/dice.js` or `game/rolls.js` crashed the CLI instead of counting as tampering. `game/cli.js` is now a small front door that checks the seal first and then loads `game/cli-main.js`.
- Fixed: the README quest sample ran before a world existed.
- Fixed: a late revoke now also takes back the bonus the solve paid.
- Fixed: a revoked solve no longer shows in the ending stats. A cheated verdict leaving an NPC asleep is pinned.
- Accepted, not fixed: the `JSDND_DICE_PATH`, `JSDND_ROLLS_PATH`, and `JSDND_DICE_SEAL` overrides are honored in production (honor system, spec section 4). A one-line or malformed seal reads as "missing or broken". `move-<id>.old.js` is overwritten if it already exists. The never-settled error has no machine code field.

## Fixed since they were recorded

- Modifiers hook stopped at `heroStats`: fixed in Plan 6.
- Legacy `fight end` and `fight log` could close or write to a combat fight: fixed with `assertLegacyFight`.
- Spec 5.10 stale against the ending decisions: updated.
- Page tests did not pin the legacy-vs-boss unlock, the outcome filter, or a cross-save boss win: added in the Plan 7 fix pass.

## Found by the final review of the multi-language plan, 2026-11-09

- Fixed: a quest check that returned `undefined` or `NaN` showed a raw `{gave}` placeholder or `null`, because the check parts cross the child process as JSON. `quests/messages.js` now turns those values into text first.
- Fixed: the combat move starter file was always English. It is now written from the catalogs in the save language, and `game/moves.js` is on the lint guard list.
- Fixed: the integration tests never ran the translator strictly. `tests/game/helpers.js` now sets `JSDND_I18N_STRICT=1`, which spawned CLI processes inherit.
- Deferred minors:
  - The lint guard's `PROSE` pattern skips any string containing `{ } < > = ;`, so a catalog string pasted back inline with a placeholder passes, and so does prose inside markup in `game/ending-page.js`.
  - `game/cli-main.js` collapse line: the fallback location text ("the spot where they stood") is English in a Ukrainian save.
  - `.claude/commands/play.md` tells the Master to build the collapse message from the English line, not the localized `error` field.
  - `game/ending-page.js` honor tooltips use the stored English `reason`.
  - `game/statusline.js` on a database without migration 12: `effectiveLanguage` throws, the reading is not stored until a CLI command migrates.
  - `game/i18n.js`: a plural entry with a non-finite or string count returns `other` with the placeholders unfilled (strict mode throws).
  - `game/locales/uk.js`: the banned phrases `на завершення` and `зануримося в` are everyday Ukrainian and reject normal world text. The class and race aliases have no feminine forms (`чарівниця`, `жриця`, `ельфійка`). Both are Gogi's call in the language review.
  - `setup.sh`: re-running setup and pressing Enter saves English over an existing Ukrainian save, and `ua` is read as English.
  - `README.md` repo layout row for `quests/` still says briefs and stubs, which moved to `quests/text/`. `CLAUDE.md` says no player-facing string is inline, which `game/cli-main.js` error text still breaks by decision.
  - Not judged: a Node build without Ukrainian ICU after `uk` is chosen in `/play`, and whether the banned phrase `як ші` causes false positives.

## Found by the final review of the hero status bar, 2026-11-09

- Fixed: a clean solve judged during an open fight healed the hero but not the fight row, so the next hit or a flee wrote the old health back. `healHero` now writes through to the open fight.
- Deferred minors:
  - A revoke takes back `complexity * 5` gold even for a solve made before migration 13, which never paid gold. Only saves that existed before the upgrade are affected.
  - The hero name and place name go into the status line raw. A name with a newline or an escape code breaks the bar, because `createHeroFromChoices` only trims and the world text check has no control character rule like `nameItem` has.
  - Test gaps: "revoking a solve that gave no item" actually solves through `judgeQuest`, and the tamper reset with `fullHeal` is not run end to end under a missing dice file (checked by hand, works).
- Gogi's call: gold and items survive a tamper reset, so re-solving in the new epoch pays again.
- Not judged: an unparseable `hp_updated_at` makes `syncHp` throw (hand-edited DB only), up to 29 leftover regeneration minutes are lost per fight by design, `hero show` reads the hero and vitals in separate statements.

## Play harness follow-up (PR #14), 2026-11-09

- Fixed: the play hook and the resume state no longer import the sealed dice files (`game/fight-state.js`), so a missing or broken `dice.js` or `rolls.js` cannot crash the hook.
- Fixed: `resumeState` is the one source for the `resume` command, the compaction dump, and the `[game]` line, and now carries language, pack, vitals, and display names. The line shows health and gold.
- Fixed: the auto-approval of game commands moved from the committed settings to `play.sh` (`--allowedTools`, this launch only). `play.sh` warns below Claude Code 2.1.271.
- Added: `world-smith` (Opus) writes the world, with the Master writing it as the fallback.
- Ruling: the contributor's `pause(2)` in the ending test stays. The test passed 10 of 10 runs with it and 20 of 20 without it, so the flake was not reproduced, but the pause costs nothing and guarantees the boss win lands strictly after the last solve.
- Unchecked until a live run: that `claude "/play" --model sonnet --allowedTools "..."` parses `/play` as the prompt and the tool rule as one value, that the model of a `world-smith` run is Opus, and that the compaction line survives a real long session.
- Deferred minors:
  - `play.sh` messages are English only: the save language is not known before the game starts.
  - `RESUMING` is checked in both `game/cli.js` and `game/cli-main.js`. Two copies of the same rule.
  - A hook failure still shows Claude Code's own non-blocking hook error if Node itself cannot start. Nothing in the repo can change that.
  - `omitClaudeMd` is ignored by Claude Code older than 2.1.271, so `move-smith` and `world-smith` then load CLAUDE.md and cost more. The game still works.

### Found by the final review of the play harness follow-up, 2026-11-09

- Fixed: a `world-smith` that gave up after three rejected tries came back as a normal result, so the Master had no instruction to write the world itself. Onboarding now checks `world status` and falls back when the world is not complete, and never calls world-smith twice.
- Fixed: the README, `README.uk.md`, and `play.sh` called 2.1.271 "the version this was built and tested on". It is the oldest supported version (where `omitClaudeMd` starts working), and the game was tested on 2.1.311.
- Deferred minors:
  - `SKILL.md` still describes the `[game]` line without HP and gold, so the Master may spend a `hero show` call it does not need.
  - `world-smith.md` says "use only what they return" while the Master may pass the player's tone or place wishes in its brief. A literal reading ignores them.
  - Test gaps: `resume` for a save with the setting saved but no world filled is correct (checked by hand) but not pinned, and the `play.sh` stub never makes `claude --version` exit non-zero.
- Not judged: whether `/play` as the first CLI argument fires the prompt hook, whether subagents inherit `--allowedTools`, and that a plain `/play` launch (without `play.sh`) now asks for approval on every game command, `world-smith`'s included. That last one follows the decision to keep the allow rule out of the committed settings.

## Found by the review of rung 1 of the curriculum, 2026-11-09

- Fixed: `strings-count-label` passed an `es`/`ies` solution on about 70 percent of runs, because only random nouns ended in s, x, or y. Fixed cases added and the brief now says so.
- Fixed: `strings-middle` passed a solution that trims its text on about 60 percent of runs. Fixed cases with spaces at the ends added and the brief says spaces count.
- Fixed: the failure messages of four quests turned undefined and NaN into `null`. One shared `show` helper in `quests/messages.js` prints them as themselves.
- Deferred minors:
  - No check wraps the player's call in try/catch, so a crash in a plausible beginner bug (`counts.hasOwnProperty(w)`, a merge without a null guard) is reported as a raw error without the input that caused it. Same pattern as `string-shout` from the start.
  - `countLabel` is not tested with negative or decimal counts; by the brief `-1` gives `'-1 apples'`.
  - `arrays-first-last` never checks that a new array is returned for `[]` (`return items` passes), although the brief says new array.
  - `tests/game/navigation.test.js` and `tests/game/cli.test.js` assume every registered quest is on rung 1 (`QUESTS.slice(1)`); they will fail loudly when rung 2 is registered and must be rewritten then.
  - The Ukrainian drafts still need the owner's review (checklist rows added).
